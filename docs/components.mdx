# Component Integration

Components are a key part of documentation sites, this page demonstrates how Astro and Docusaurus handle components.

## Astro's Multi-Framework Approach

Astro allows you to use components from multiple frameworks simultaneously:

```tsx
- - -
import { QwikCounter } from '@/components/qwik/counter';
import { ReactCounter } from '@/components/react/counter';
- - -

<div>
  <QwikCounter />  <!-- Qwik component -->
  <ReactCounter /> <!-- React component -->
</div>
```

This flexibility enables you to:
- Use the best package for each use case
- Leverage existing components from different ecosystems (including design systems)
- Mix server and client components seamlessly

## React Components
Astro seamlessly supports React components, similar to Docusaurus:


<Showcase>
  <div slot="preview">
    <SelectScrollable client:load />
  </div>
  <div slot="code">
    ```tsx
    import * as React from "react"

    import {
      Select,
      SelectContent,
      SelectGroup,
      SelectItem,
      SelectLabel,
      SelectTrigger,
      SelectValue,
    } from "@/components/ui/select"

    export function SelectScrollable() {
      const timezones = {
        northAmerica: [
          { value: "est", label: "Eastern Standard Time (EST)" },
          { value: "cst", label: "Central Standard Time (CST)" },
          { value: "mst", label: "Mountain Standard Time (MST)" },
          { value: "pst", label: "Pacific Standard Time (PST)" },
          { value: "akst", label: "Alaska Standard Time (AKST)" },
          { value: "hst", label: "Hawaii Standard Time (HST)" }
        ],
        europeAfrica: [
          { value: "gmt", label: "Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)" },
          { value: "cet", label: "Central European Time (CET)" },
          { value: "eet", label: "Eastern European Time (EET)" },
          { value: "west", label: "Western European Summer Time (WEST)" },
          { value: "cat", label: "Central Africa Time (CAT)" },
          { value: "eat", label: "East Africa Time (EAT)" }
        ],
        asia: [
          { value: "msk", label: "Moscow Time (MSK)" },
          { value: "ist", label: "India Standard Time (IST)" },
          { value: "cst_china", label: "China Standard Time (CST)" },
          { value: "jst", label: "Japan Standard Time (JST)" },
          { value: "kst", label: "Korea Standard Time (KST)" },
          { value: "ist_indonesia", label: "Indonesia Central Standard Time (WITA)" }
        ],
        australiaPacific: [
          { value: "awst", label: "Australian Western Standard Time (AWST)" },
          { value: "acst", label: "Australian Central Standard Time (ACST)" },
          { value: "aest", label: "Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST)" },
          { value: "nzst", label: "New Zealand Standard Time (NZST)" },
          { value: "fjt", label: "Fiji Time (FJT)" }
        ],
        southAmerica: [
          { value: "art", label: "Argentina Time (ART)" },
          { value: "bot", label: "Bolivia Time (BOT)" },
          { value: "brt", label: "Brasilia Time (BRT)" },
          { value: "clt", label: "Chile Standard Time (CLT)" }
        ]
      };

      return (
        <Select>
          <SelectTrigger className="w-[280px]">
            <SelectValue placeholder="Select a timezone" />
          </SelectTrigger>
          <SelectContent>
            {Object.entries(timezones).map(([region, zones]) => (
              <SelectGroup key={region}>
                <SelectLabel>
                  {region
                    .replace(/([A-Z])/g, ' $1')
                    .split(' ')
                    .map(word => word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1))
                    .join(' ')
                    .trim()}
                </SelectLabel>
                {zones.map(({ value, label }) => (
                  <SelectItem key={value} value={value}>
                    {label}
                  </SelectItem>
                ))}
              </SelectGroup>
            ))}
          </SelectContent>
        </Select>
      );
    }

    ```
  </div>
</Showcase>

Benefits:
- Familiar React development experience
- Access to the vast React ecosystem
- Fine-grained control over hydration with `client:` directives

The example above is a React Select component from [Shadcn/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/). 

## Qwik Components
Astro also supports Qwik components, offering unique performance benefits:

```tsx
import { QwikCounter } from '@/components/qwik/counter';

<QwikCounter /> <!-- No client-side hydration needed -->
```

Key advantages:
- Sends only HTML - no JavaScript until interaction
- No need for directives, since there is no hydration
- Perfect for highly interactive documentation

Like video streaming, Qwik uses a buffering system that runs in a separate thread to buffer JavaScript just before it's needed. This means your documentation stays lightweight and fast, while still providing rich interactivity when users need it.

Qwik also allows for server first ui state management, which is a great fit for documentation sites. An example being the sidebar navigation and version selector on this site.

In most documentation sites, these components would have to be persisted on the client with a script tag.


<Showcase>
  <div slot="preview">
    <div class="flex flex-col gap-4">
      <div>Qwik Counter: <QwikCounter /></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div slot="code">
    ```tsx
    import { component$ } from "@builder.io/qwik";
    import { QwikCounter } from "../components/qwik/counter";

    export default component$(() => {
      return <QwikCounter />;
    });
    ```
  </div>
</Showcase>

## Docusaurus React Components
Docusaurus provides a focused React-based approach:

```jsx
import { Counter } from '@/components/Counter';

export default function Page() {
  return <Counter />;
}
```

Components can be customized through "swizzling" - Docusaurus's way of ejecting and modifying built-in components:

```bash
# Eject a component for customization
docusaurus swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic Footer
```

## Performance mention

For both this POC and the Docusaurus main site, we ran through Google PageSpeed Insights, which measures key performance metrics in both simulated and real-world conditions across strained networks.

Both pages contained similar levels of content and interactivity, the results are as follows:

### Docusaurus

The Docusaurus main site averaged around 50-60 score, with its main issues being around work on the main thread, such as third party scripts, along with a large amount of render delay due to prefetching.

This causes low TBT and LCP scores. Based on the real user data from the CrUX report, the [INP score](https://web.dev/articles/inp) was 283ms, which is particularly concerning for documentation sites.

Why INP Matters for Documentation:
- Users frequently interact with navigation, search, and code samples
- Documentation requires quick jumps between sections and pages
- Poor interaction responsiveness can significantly impact developer productivity
- Common documentation features like syntax highlighting and code copying need to feel instant

The high INP score indicates that users may experience noticeable delays when interacting with the site, which can be frustrating when trying to quickly find or reference documentation.

### Astro

Now for this POC we're unable to collect real user data, as that takes a 28 day period to collect the crux report, although we can compare the pagespeed insights scores.

In this case, the Astro POC averaged around a 99-100 score. Most of the "outer shell" of the docs consists of Qwik components, which are HTML until your users opt-in to a specific interaction.

INP levels should remain low, as Qwik's buffering system is able to preload in a worker pool, as well as compile and parse the JavaScript off the main thread (something that can't be done in a service worker).

Where the Astro POC could improve is the number of DOM nodes and chained requests. (The DOM nodes are heavily reduced in the upcoming Qwik v2 release)
