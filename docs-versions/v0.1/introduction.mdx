# Docusaurus vs Astro

This proof-of-concept explores two leading documentation platforms: Docusaurus and Astro. The goal is to evaluate Astro as an alternative to Docusaurus by addressing key considerations:

- Feature parity and capabilities
- Versioning implementation
- Framework flexibility and integration
- Developer experience

This documentation site is built with Astro.
