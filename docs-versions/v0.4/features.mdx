# Framework Comparison

Both Docusaurus and Astro offer compelling features for documentation sites. Here's how they compare across key considerations:

## Feature Parity
- **Docusaurus**: Purpose-built for documentation with integrated versioning, search, and navigation
- **Astro**: Flexible architecture supporting documentation alongside other site types

## Framework Integration
- **Docusaurus**: React-based with limited framework options
- **Astro**: Multi-framework support including React, Vue, Svelte, and more

## Developer Experience
- **Docusaurus**: Opinionated structure with documentation-specific tooling
- **Astro**: More flexible but requires additional setup for documentation features
