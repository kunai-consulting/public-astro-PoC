# Code Examples

Both Astro and Docusaurus offer robust support for code examples in documentation. Let's explore how they handle syntax highlighting and code blocks.

## Astro (Current Implementation)
Astro uses Shiki for syntax highlighting by default, providing VS Code-like highlighting accuracy. Here's a basic example:

```js
function calculateInterest(principal, rate, years) {
  return principal * (1 + (rate / 100) * years);
}

const earnings = calculateInterest(1000, 5, 2);  // $1000 at 5% for 2 years
```

This is using Astro's default configuration, which provides:
- Clean, readable syntax highlighting
- Language-specific coloring
- Proper code indentation

## Docusaurus Features
Docusaurus includes additional features out of the box:
- Line highlighting
- Line numbers
- Copy code button
- File names in code blocks
- Live code editor support

Example Docusaurus syntax:
```md
​```jsx title="example.jsx" {2-4}
function MyComponent() {
  // These lines would be highlighted
  const value = "Hello";
  return <div>{value}</div>;
}
​```
```

## Which to Choose?
- Choose **Docusaurus** if you need code-related features immediately without setup
- Choose **Astro** if you prefer:
  - More accurate syntax highlighting
  - Custom implementation of features
  - Greater flexibility in styling and behavior

We'll be exploring how to add Docusaurus-like features to Astro in upcoming sections.

> **Fun fact**: It's possible to achieve basic syntax highlighting using [just a font!](https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/font-with-built-in-syntax-highlighting/) Using OpenType features and color tables, some fonts can detect and colorize code patterns without any JavaScript.
