# Framework Comparison: Astro vs Docusaurus v0.2

Both Astro and Docusaurus are powerful frameworks for building documentation sites. Here's what they offer out of the box:

## Shared Features

Both frameworks come with these features by default:
- 📝 Support for TSX, Markdown, and MDX
- 🗂️ File-based routing 
- 📚 Versioning support (with plugins)
- 🔍 Site search integration (Algolia, Pagefind)
- 🌍 i18n (internationalization) support
- 🎨 Dark/Light mode theming
- 📊 Custom analytics and tracking capabilities

## Docusaurus Advantages
- 🚀 Simple, quick implementation (cookiecutter approach)
- 🔌 Built-in integrations with many popular tools
- 📦 Pre-built documentation features
- ⏱️ Reduced initial development time

## Docusaurus Limitations
- 🏗️ Uses Webpack by default (slower builds compared to Vite)
- 🔒 Limited SSR capabilities - primarily optimized for static site generation
- 🔍 Known SEO issues (incorrect generated URLs, file to URL conversions)
- 🎨 Limited control over certain UI elements (e.g., previous/next buttons, archive page title)
- 👥 Limited control over user roles and permissions

## Astro Advantages
- ⚡ Vite-based build system for faster development
- 🎯 "Zero JS by default" approach for better performance
- 🔄 Full SSR support
- 🎨 More flexible theming and customization options
- 🏗️ Island architecture for optimal client-side interactivity

## Astro Limitations
- 📦 State management across islands requires additional setup (though solutions like nanostores work well)
- 🌱 Ecosystem is less mature compared to React (but React components can be used within Astro)
