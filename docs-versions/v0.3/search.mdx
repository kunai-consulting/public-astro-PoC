# Search: Docusaurus vs Astro

## Docusaurus Search
Docusaurus integrates with Algolia DocSearch as its default search solution, providing a powerful search experience for documentation sites. This hosted solution manages the indexing process and delivers real-time search results with built-in typo tolerance.

While Algolia DocSearch offers a polished, ready-to-use solution, it does require application and approval for their free crawler service. The search UI comes pre-configured out of the box, though this means there's less room for customization.

Some considerations:
- Requires application and approval from Algolia for free DocSearch crawler
- Limited control over search index and crawling behavior
- Requires external service dependency

## Astro + Pagefind
Astro provides flexibility in choosing search solutions, with support for popular options like Algolia DocSearch. For this POC, we've implemented Pagefind, a modern static search solution that operates without external services.

- Pagefind is a static search solution that works without external services
- Generates search index at build time
- Fully self-hosted with no external dependencies
- Lightweight (~6KB core JS)
- Works offline after initial load
- Customizable UI components
- Full control over indexing and search behavior
- Supports multiple languages
- Built-in content prefiltering
- Version-specific search functionality - results are scoped to the current documentation version
- May require more setup compared to Algolia's managed solution

## Key Differences
- **Hosting**: Algolia is cloud-hosted, Pagefind is self-hosted
- **Setup**: Algolia requires approval and API keys, Pagefind works out of the box
- **Control**: Pagefind offers more control over indexing and search behavior
- **Performance**: Both are fast, but Pagefind works offline after initial load
- **Maintenance**: Algolia is managed, Pagefind requires self-maintenance
- **Cost**: Algolia has usage limits and paid tiers, Pagefind is free and open-source
