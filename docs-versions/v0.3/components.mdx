# Component Integration

Let's explore how Astro and Docusaurus handle components in documentation sites.

## Astro's Multi-Framework Approach
Astro allows you to use components from multiple frameworks simultaneously:

```tsx
- - -
import { QwikCounter } from '@/components/qwik/counter';
import { ReactCounter } from '@/components/react/counter';
- - -

<div>
  <QwikCounter />  <!-- Qwik component -->
  <ReactCounter /> <!-- React component -->
</div>
```

This flexibility enables you to:
- Use the best framework for each use case
- Leverage existing components from different ecosystems
- Mix server and client components seamlessly

## Docusaurus React Components
Docusaurus provides a focused React-based approach:

```jsx
import { Counter } from '@/components/Counter';

export default function Page() {
  return <Counter />;
}
```

Benefits include:
- Consistent React development experience
- Deep integration with React ecosystem
- Standardized component patterns

> **Fun fact**: The sidebar navigation and version selector on this site are server-side interactive using Qwik! In traditional client-side frameworks like React, these components would require client-side JavaScript to handle their initial state. With Qwik's resumability, they're interactive from the server without hydration.
